chip --package

chip inside package

zoom in inside package

wirebond - solid phase welding process, where two metallic materials (wire and pad surface) are brought into intimate contact

design present inside the chip very small- 5nm/7nm
io pads - connect core( all gates, logic gates and all) (inside world) to outside world
io pads - a very huge domain
	- needs to be protected -from charges in not damaging the core  - esd


Core

ADC- Analog to convert to digital signal

only allow low frequencies signal to pass into the core

Foundry IP- high value 
if the (soc)design inside the core need higher frequency than can provide by the outside
eg: have a booster to boost the frequency - provided 50 MHz then needed 100Mhz
every foundry gives you different transistor 

Macros
-eg: rtl 
-prety easy code

CBB - custom building block
